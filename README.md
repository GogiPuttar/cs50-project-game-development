# cs50-project-game-development
Final project to complete cs50 with specialisation in game development.
The code has been developed in Lua and the game runs on [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/).
It's an augmentation to a game very similar to mario allowing movement, interaction with objects and procedural generation of environment in 2D.
Despite this being an extension, every line of code has been added by me based on my understanding.

The augmentation is inspired from the [meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl959QnD3lM) WIDE PUTIN.
When the user-controlled character captures the flag and completes the objective, they becomes W I D E and the track of the meme starts playing in the background. 

Further augmentations and improvement include:
* Addition of levels and checkpoints
* Further interaction with different objects
* Addition of variables like health and score
* More extensive procedural generation of the environment
